      Liangpi, or spicy cold chinese noodles, is a dish usually prepared during
      the hot summer weather. It is very tasty and I always feel happier after
      eating it. Here are the ingredients to make it yourself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wide, flat wheat flour noodles</li>
      <li>Cilantro</li>
      <li>Tofu</li>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Sesame sauce</li>
    </ul>

      I play the acoustic guitar (I have an electric one as well) eventhough I
      am not great at music theory or any of that stuff. I just enjoy and play
      music that I like rather than forcing myself to learn music theory. To me,
      playing guitar is a very soothing and relaxing time of my day where I can
      completely remove myself from outside distractions.

      YOASOBI is a japanese band consisting of just two people, Ayase who is the
      producer and Ikura who is the singer. Their slogan is "novel to music"
      meaning most of their songs are based off of short stories. I found
      YOASOBI in grade 8 and I really enjoyed their music from the start. Their
      best song by far is "Racing Into the Night" which is inspired by "Thanatos
      no Yuwaku," a short story created by Mayo Hoshino.

      I love Stephen Curry since he inspired me to play basketball at a young
      age. If you don't know him, he is the greatest shooter of all time and he
      has won multiple championships. He currently playes on the Golden State
      Warriors and I always cheer for them throughout each season. When I get
      older and can afford it, I really want to fly our my Dad and I and watch
      one of their games since he also enjoys watching basketball.
